# Mastering Distributed Tracing
This is the code repository for [Mastering Distributed Tracing](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-distributed-tracing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788628464), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the book
Mastering Distributed Tracing provides comprehensive coverage of the tracing field. Solve problems through code instrumentation with open standards, and learn how to profile complex systems. The book will also prepare you to operate and enhance your own tracing infrastructure.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter04.


The code will look like the following:
```
type SpanContext struct {
      traceID TraceID
      spanID SpanID
      flags byte
      baggage map[string]string
      debugID string
}
```
